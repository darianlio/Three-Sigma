## Description
Web app that collects the price history of a given stock or crypto currency symbol with the selected time series. 
Visualizes the price history in a line graph. Able to make predictions for the next 10 iterations in the selected time series.

## Dependencies
* Node.js
* Neataptic
* Chart.js

## APIs used
* Alpha Vantage

## How it works
The user enters a stock/crypto currency symbol to be queried as well as the time series they would like to see. The app then 
makes an API call to collect the time series data of the commodity and plots it. The user can then press the predict button to 
predict the next 10 iterations in the time series. 

### Training
When the predict button is pressed, the prices of the stock collected from the previous API call will be propagated to another function. 
The stock time series data is then used as the training set. 

#### Example Training set
A [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) is is used to predict the time series data.
This type of model uses supervised learning. Therefore, an input and output must be provided in the training set. However, only
the price of the stock from before is used. 

Example stock price data: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

output: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

After training the model, it will then be asked to predict the output value given an input value of 5.

Training data is also normalized using the following equation in order to improve convergence:

NormalizedValue = (ValueToNormalize - min)/(max - min)

#### Model Specifications
Using the training data, an [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) model is built. 
The model used to train our data uses 1 input node and 1 output node with 12 memory blocks. The model has an error rate of 0.1. It will train the model by iterating it 1000 or when the error rate of 0.1 is achieved. The learning rate is an exponential function that 0.9 and gets reduced by 10% after each iteration. Finally, the model uses a [MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) cost function to minimize prediction error.
